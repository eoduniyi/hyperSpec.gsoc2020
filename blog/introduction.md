[A Short Introduction to Spectroscopy:  
_Notes on Information, Energy, Matter, and Light_  
_By Erick O. Oduniyi_]()

**I will start with a poem I wrote a while back (circa Spring 2017):**

> _light systems are constructed to give guidance in the dark_
>
> _in social interactions_
>
> _in stressful moments_
>
> _and most importantly into ourselves_
>
> _Celestial Bodies_
>
> _Waves_
>
> _God_

___
**Electromagnetic Radiation (EM):**
> Atomic decay of electrons.

---
**Information:**
> "The average uncertainty in a random variable."
> --  _Claude Shannon_

---
**energy:**
> The ability to do work on an object.

---
**matter:**
> The sum of atoms in an object.

---
**light:**
> A particular case of EM:
>
> **visible light**
>
> **infrared**
>
> **ultraviolet**


---
**Spectroscopy:**
> ```R
> # The study of functional interactions between matter and light
> Spectroscopy <- function(matter, light) {
>   result <- interaction(matter, light)
>   result
> }
> ```

The `result` retrieved from `Spectroscopy` is **data**.

---
**Intelligence (Creativity):**
> To go from `result` (data) to **insight** (understanding) there must be some intermediary system that posses **intelligence** and or **creativity**. Here's a difficult problem: _adequately defining intelligence, creativity, and insight_.


---
**Communication**
> The act of **transmitting** and **receiving** information.

---
**Miscommunication (Error)**
> An error in the processing of information.

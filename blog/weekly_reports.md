# Report for Week of 5-11-20

### 1. Package skeleton
Create a package skeleton and associated github repo that contains unittest and continuous integration.

#### 1.1 Creating a hyperSpec package skeleton
Because I will be creating a lot of R packages there should be a package pattern to ensure a consistent infrastructure style is present across the hyperSpec ecosystem. Every hyperSpec package should then include the following components:

  1. Github repository
  2. R project file
  3. unit test via `testthat`
  4. continuous integration (CI) via [travis]() and [appveyor]()
  5. code coverage via `covr` and [codecov.io]()

##### 1.1.1 Create a Github repository

##### 1.1.2 Create a R package via RStudio

##### 1.1.3 Set up testthat for unittesting

##### 1.1.4 Set up CI for travis and appveyor

##### 1.1.5 Set up code coverage

##### 1.1.6 Adding badges

### 2. Package building
Read up on git-lfs, CMAKE, win-builder, and r-hub

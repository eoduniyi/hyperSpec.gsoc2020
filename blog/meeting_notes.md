### Github workflow
In general, the workflow for contributing to the the hyperSpec ecosystem is the following:
  1. Create an issue proposing a feature, specifying a bugfix or something more vanilla (i.e., documentation, styling, etc.)
  2. Discuss issue and design with contributors
  3. Create a new branch that will contain the issue implementation
  4. Commit and push until issue is implemented
  5. Submit a pull request from the newly created issue branch
  6. Code review
  7. Make necessary changes
  8. Merge branch into master/development

### Package skeleton
TODO: Create a package skeleton and associated github repo that contains unittest and contious integration.

### Package building
TODO: Read up on git-lfs, cMAKE, win-builder, and r-hub

**Note:** I should install the R development branch via subversion

### Development Trajectory
In terms of contributing, there are a number of entry points I can start on:
* going on with hyperspec.tidyverse
* integration with ggplot2
* tackling issue of taking out file import filters and putting them in their own package

**Note:** Different instrument manufactures have unique local import and export formats

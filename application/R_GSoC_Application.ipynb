    "### Overview\n",
    "I have always had an interest in technology. Everything from how the technology was designed to interact with users, the manufacturing innovations that the technology requires to reach multiple users, and the physical form a product takes over generations have always fascinated me. Now, as an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) student I continue to develop my passion for applying mathematical, computational, and digital tools from EECS to the study and augmentation of biological, cognitive, cultural, and electro-mechanical systems. Concretely, my scientific background is rooted in my research experiences: employing cognitive and software-defined radios for mobile spectrum sensing, modeling the impact of media engagement on infectious diseases, utilizing sentiment analysis and physiological sensing (e.g.skin conductance, facial electromyography) for storytelling and cognition, and the design of speech recognition systems as a representation of early language acquisition. Unifying these diverse research interests and experiences is Systems theory – the interdisciplinary study of natural and man-made systems. Ultimately, through the application of systems theory (systems thinking), my research aims to reveal and understand the broad complex communication paradigms within and between animal, machine, plant, and environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualifying Background\n",
    "My education as an undergraduate EECS student has provided me with foundations in programming, data structures, and software engineering, all of which are critical to successful open source development. Beyond the classroom, I have also been fortunate enough to undertake numerous research experiences and internships. For example, this past summer I was a research intern at Harvard University’s Long-Term Ecological Research site (LTER), Harvard-Forest (HF). At HF I was working under the Data Provenance team where I had the opportunity to be mentored by computer science and ecology professors and graduate students in basic R software development. During my time as an intern, I wrote a proposal for a new R package called provBookR, collected informal user requirements from HF scientists and students. From there, I processed these user requirements to generate use cases and flow diagrams (a common practice in software engineering and product design). After generating user requirements I spent the rest of the summer developing the provBookR prototype and learning about the currently available R data provenance tools and packages created by the HF Data Provenance team. In the end, this experience was extremely valuable because it introduced me to data provenance, open-source development (working with in-person and remote teams), R package development, and being comfortable with going through code repositories and documentation until my eyes fall out. Additionally, during my other internships (i.e., Santa Fe Institute, KU Ecology Department) I primarily used R for data analysis and synthesis. Hence, I believe I'm qualified to learn and contribute to the hyperSpec project for GSoC 2020."

    "## Coding Plan and Methods\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background\n",
    "The [hyperSpec](http://hyperspec.r-forge.r-project.org/) package allows R users a suite of utilities for manipulating spectroscopic data. These utilities currently include functions for importing spectroscopic data (e.g., Raman, IR, NIR, UV/VIS), plotting, and preprocessing and wrangling spectroscopic objects (i.e., hyperSpec objects) so that they can be easily integrated with commonly used statistical analysis packages (e.g., **plsr** and **MASS**). On the one hand, the usefulness of the hyperSpec package for spectroscopic research is clear and immediately useful to R programmers and practitioners of bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, and medical statistics. On the other hand, the infrastructure afforded by hyperSpec has led to various dependencies on other R packages, large amounts of test data, and more than a hundred .R files. Accordingly, the current state of the package has become difficult to maintain and vulnerable to fixes related to dependencies on deprecated packages. Thus, the project **Fortification of the hyperSpec R Package** aims to tackle these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "At a high-level, there are three goals of the proposed project: _**distilling** the original hyperSpec package, **shielding** against package dependencies, and **bridging** hyperSpec with other relevant packages_. Accomplishing each of these goals will result in the fortification of hyperSpec's software architecture and the creation of a new ecosystem of R spectroscopic tools.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal 1: Distilling hyperSpec\n",
    "The first goal works to reduce the package footprint by distilling and retaining core computationally inexpensive functionality within the original hyperSpec package and outsourcing computationally expensive functionality (i.e., file import functions) across smaller and specialized packages. The result of this goal will make the original and subsequent hyperSpec packages easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal 2: Shielding hyperSpec\n",
    "The second goal works to protect the package by striving for a balanced approach to package dependencies. This goal is less about making sure hyperSpec is completely decoupled from other packages and more about ensuring the features and procedures the hyperSpec package depends are actively maintained on CRAN and successful non-CRAN packages that themselves are reliable. For instance, if hyperSpec depends on two packages that provide the same functionality, then hyperSpec should only rely one of those packages (assuming there is not a straightforward base R solution); ideally the package that itself has fewer dependencies and/or has a longer life history on CRAN (i.e., fewer updates) and success within the R developer community. Because CRAN package errors are commonly the result of updates in package dependencies, the result of this goal will bring control back to hyperSpec making it anti-fragile. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/Picture2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal 3: Bridging hyperSpec\n",
    "The third goal works to build packages that make hyperSpec and hyperSpec objects easier to integrate with relevant data cleaning, spectroscopic, and statistical analysis packages. For example, integrating hyperSpec with spectra preprocessing packages like **baseline** and **EMC**, data wrangling and plotting packages like **dplyr** and **magrittr**, and **ggplot2**; file import functions like the **readJDX** package. The result of this goal will generate several small hyperSpec companion packages (e.g., hyperSpec.read, hyperSpec.tidyverse, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/Picture1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Planning\n",
    "Whether developing big or small software projects, robust software development is no easy task. Software development requires extensive design and planning, clear implementation, verification, and testing; all of which should be done iteratively. In fact, software projects often require a team of developers that span these tasks: designing, implementing, reviewing, testing, and documenting. However, because of the nature of open-source projects one, more, or all of these tasks can fall on the shoulders of a single developer. As a result, the coverage of these tasks can vary widely. The beauty of open source is that through engagement and strong communication, solo endeavors turn into community projects that support contributors from around the world that work together to develop robust software systems. I believe at the heart of successful communities is planning and clear communication, the guiding principles of my coding project. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coding Project\n",
    "From the three high-level goals, it is clear that my coding project is package fortification and lean package development. A plan that proposes to execute this coding project and as a result the goals of the project is the following development cycle: generate software description, function design, function implementation, quality plan, test plan, documentation plan, deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/Picture3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Software Description\n",
    "I will always first \"sketch\" out the description of the task that need completed as specified and agreed upon with my mentors. I expect these tasks to often come in the form of GitHub issues or through other communication channels. Depending on the complexity of and formality of the task at hand, these description sketches will take the form of briefly typed notes or more formal mock-ups of user requirements and use case diagrams. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/Picture4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Design\n",
    "Depending on the complexity of the software description, I will develop R pseudo-code specifying function assumptions, inputs, outputs, and side effects. I find it helpful to generate software descriptions and function designs in Rmarkdown first. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rename.hyperSpec <- function(.data){\n",
    "  res <- rename(.data)\n",
    "  return{res}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Implementation\n",
    "For function implementation I will follow Hadley Wickham's R code workflow as discussed in his [R packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html): create .R file giving it an appropriate and clear name, explore the code in the console, \"rinse and repeat\" until the function is implemented as specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/function_implementation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality Plan\n",
    "I will write anti-fragile code that can be refactored, extended, and tested easily. At a high-level, this means the code will not be unnecessarily clever or confusing to my mentors, other students, and especially my future self. Any code that is written will adhere to the style/standard of the hyperSpec code base. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing and Verification Plan\n",
    "For each function and its associated code, I will make sure to develop a comprehensive unit test. Depending on the complexity of the function (simple functions versus functions with side effects like file import/reading functions) prepare tests that checks for points of failure and potentials bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/function_testing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation Plan\n",
    "I will make sure each .R file is appropriately documented (i.e., parameters, examples, etc.) using roxygen. I will also make sure to comment sections of the code that highlight assumptions or any outstanding nuances. Finally, for each function and feature make sure there is a brief explanation on how to use it in the package vignette.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure1](Figures/function_documentation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables\n",
    "The highest level deliverable is a well documented and tested R package that distills, shields, and bridges hyperSpec with relevant R packages and tools. Of course, this high-level deliverable depends on well tested and documented functions and code.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Project Obstacles\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect and no plan is ever problem-free, so I foresee a couple of obstacles: misunderstanding of software descriptions and deliverables from mentors, lack of time to implement deliverables or spending too much time on a deliverable, and forgetting about unresolved errors, maintaining consistent code quality. To overcome these obstacles I will always keep mentors up to date with progress and set expectations early and adjust them accordingly. In particular, my expectations for a successful R GSoC experience consist of keeping myself enthusiastic and accountable for completing work and associated deliverables throughout the summer, as well as, considerate of my mentors, other participating students time. Finally, I expect myself to be appropriately open and remain cooperative across disciplines and people in addition to actively listening to concerns, ideas, and issues, so that cross-pollinating conversations are encouraged, and assumptions, biases, and intentions are not misplaced."

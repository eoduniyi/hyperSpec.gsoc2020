# [Report for week of 8-17-20](/blog/weekly_reports.md)

Moving the remaining functions related to `read.txt` out of `hyperSpec` into `read.txt`: This will require that the functions in `hyperSpec` will become deprecated.

## Moving functions from `hyperSpec` to `hySpc.read.txt`
I'm going to need the `Deprecated.R` and `deprecation-messages.R` and copy the following functions:

+ [ ] read.txt.Horiba.R
    - [ ] `read.txt.Horiba`
    - [ ] `read.txt.Horiba.xy`
    - [ ] `read.txt.Horiba.t`
+ [ ] read.txt.long.R
    - [ ] `read.txt.long`
+ [ ] read.txt.Renishaw.R
    - [ ] `read.txt.Renishaw`
    - [ ] `read.zip.Renishaw`
+ [ ] read.txt.Shimadzu.R
    - [ ] `read.txt.Shimadzu`
+ [ ] read.txt.wide.R
    - [ ] `read.txt.wide`
+ [ ] read.txt.Witec.R
    - [ ] `read.txt.Witec`
    - [ ] `read.dat.Witec`
    - [ ] `read.txt.Witec.Graph`
+  ~~wc.R~~
    - ~~`wc`~~
+ [ ] count_lines.R
    - [ ] `count_lines`
+ [ ] read.asc.Andor.R
    - [ ] `read.asc.Andor`
+ [ ] read.asc.PerkinElmer.R
    - [ ] `read.asc.PerkinElmer`

I was absent from this meeting because I needed to help my family with some personal errands.

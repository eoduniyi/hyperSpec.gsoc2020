# Report for Week of 5-11-20

### 1. Package skeleton
Create a package skeleton and associated Github repository that contains unit test and continuous integration.

#### 1.1 Creating a hyperSpec package skeleton
Because I will be creating a lot of R packages there should be a package pattern to ensure a consistent infrastructure style is present across the hyperSpec ecosystem. Every hyperSpec package should then include the following components:

  1. Github repository
  2. R project file
  3. unit test via `testthat`
  4. continuous integration (CI) via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/)
  5. code coverage via `covr` and [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)

##### 1.1.1 Create a Github repository
Make a new Github repository for the package to be. Clone the Github repository locally. Clone the [hyperSpec.skeleton repository](https://github.com/eoduniyi/hyperSpec.skeleton). commit/publish local repository.

##### 1.1.2 Create a R package via RStudio
It is best to develop all packages from within RStudio:

1. Create a new RStudio project from the existing local repository.
2. Configure the project's build tools so that they are set to "Package".
3. Check all of the Roxygen options.
4. Edit the DESCRIPTION file appropriately.
5. Use the function `devtools::load_all()`.
6. Clean and rebuild the package.
7. Install and restart

**Note:** Should have the `devtools`, `roxygen2`, `covr`, and `testthat` R packages installed.

##### 1.1.3 Set up `testthat` for unit testing
The hyperSpec.skeleton repository comes with the necessary infrastructure for unit testing via the `testthat` package. See the [link](https://projector-video-pdf-converter.datacamp.com/5067/chapter4.pdf) for a **review on unit testing** and the [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/testthat.pdf) for the **`testthat` manual**.

**Note:** Unit test are typically written within the same file as the function definition.

##### 1.1.4 Set up CI
All hyperSpec packages include CI via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/). The .yml files for both of these services are included in the package directory.

**Note:** You need to have a Travis CI and AppVeyor account. Make sure the Travis CI and AppVeyor apps are installed in the Github repository's settings.

##### 1.1.5 Set up code coverage
All hyperSpec packages report code coverage via [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/). The .yml file for this service is included in the package directory. For generating code coverage reports from within R, see the `covr` [github repository](https://github.com/r-lib/covr) and the [package manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covr/covr.pdf).

**Note:** You need to have a codecov.io account. Make sure the Codecov app is installed in the Github repository's settings.

##### 1.1.6 Adding badges
Badges for the packages go in the READEME.md file. Badges for Travis CI, AppVeyor, Codecov, and [repo status](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) can be found on the service's respective website.

### 2. Package building
Read up on git-lfs, CMAKE, win-builder, and r-hub

### 3. hyperSpec fileIO
<s>TODO: Submit an issue for mutate/transmute.R</s>
<s>TODO: Implement mutate.R, setLabels</s>

### 4. mutate.R and setLabels.R
Implemented mutate.R and setLabels.R

`mutate.R` takes care of issue #6 and issue #7
`setLabels.R` implements updating labels as discussed in #7

TODO: Generalizing mutate/transmute as discussed in issue #12

### 5. Templates
In general, a template is pattern for a repeatable format for a document or file. The primary benefit of such a structure is that the underlying structure does not have to be recreated from scratch. This ensures a level of consistency across projects. And so indeed, it makes sense to also have templates for repositories. And if it makes sense for repositories, perhaps it also makes sense for issues, pull request, and a range of collaborative structures.

#### 5.1 Template repository
A template repository can be made in Github by going to the settings of the repository and checking the template repository box. Then, you can generate new repositories by using the url-end point:`https://github.com/username/repoistory.name/generate`. This is equivalent to clicking the "Use this template" button in the repository's code tab. Once, the derived repository is created, it's a good idea to set the template repository as a remote via  `git remote add template [URL of the template repo]`. Now, changes made to the template can be propagated to the derived repo by fetching and pulling in the changes.

# Meeting notes for 5-11-20

### License
Contributing under hyperSpec should be free

---


### Trello
Will be using Trello as a way to organize high-level task, quick links, resources, agendas, and todos

---

### hyperSpec's contributors guideline
Roman will be working on a draft. I can help by adding weekly meeting notes and weekly reports

---

### Github workflow
In general, the workflow for contributing to the the hyperSpec ecosystem is the following:
  1. Create an issue proposing a feature, specifying a bugfix or something more vanilla (i.e., documentation, styling, etc.)
  2. Discuss issue and design with contributors
  3. Create a new branch that will contain the issue implementation
  4. Commit and push until issue is implemented
  5. Submit a pull request from the newly created issue branch
  6. Code review
  7. Make necessary changes
  8. Merge branch into master/development

### Development Trajectory
In terms of contributing, there are a number of entry points I can start on:
* going on with hyperspec.tidyverse
* integration with ggplot2
* tackling issue of taking out file import filters and putting them in their own package

**Note:** Different instrument manufactures have unique local import and export formats
